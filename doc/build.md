# Building Mayastor

> You will not need to always build Mayastor. We will provide official x86_64
> & aarch64 binaries and images in future releases.

Mayastor is a multi-component [Rust][rust-lang] project that makes heavy use of
[Nix][nix-explore] for our development and build process.

If you're coming from a non-Rust (or non-Nix) background, **building Mayastor may be a bit
different than you're used to.** There is no `Makefile`, you won't need a build toolchain,
you won't need to worry about cross compiler toolchains, and all builds are reproducible.

## Prerequisites

Mayastor **only** builds on modern Linuxes. We'd adore contributions to add support for
Windows, FreeBSD, OpenWRT, or other server platforms.

If you do not have a Linux system:

- **Windows:** We recommend using [WSL2][windows-wsl2] if you only need to
  build Mayastor. You'll need a [Hyper-V VM][windows-hyperv] if you want to use it.
- **Mac:** We recommend you use [Docker for Mac][docker-install]
  and follow the Docker process described. Please let us know if you find a way to
  run it!
- **FreeBSD:** We _think_ this might actually work, SPDK is compatible! But, we haven't
  tried it yet.
- **Others:** This is kind of a "Do-it-yourself" situation. Sorry, we can't be more help!

The only thing your system needs to build Mayastor is [**Nix**][nix-install].

Usually [Nix][nix-install] can be installed via (Do **not** use `sudo`!):

```bash
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

> **Can't install Nix?**
>
> That's totally fine. You can use [`docker`][docker-install] just fine for one-off or occasional PRs!
>
> This flow will get you a pre-fetched `nix` store:
>
> ```bash
> docker run --name mayastor-nix-prefetch -it -v $(pwd):/scratch:rw --privileged --workdir /scratch nixos/nix nix-shell --run "exit 0"
> docker commit mayastor-nix-prefetch mayastor/dev-env:latest
> docker rm mayastor-nix-prefetch
> docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/scratch:rw --workdir /scratch mayastor/dev-env:latest nix-shell
> ```
>
> To re-enter, just run the last command again.

- Some of our team uses [NixOS][nixos] which has `nix` baked in, but you don't need to.
- Some of our team uses [`direnv][direnv], but you don't need to.

For some tasks, we use features from `nixUnstable`. You can use `nixos-unstable`
**(or `nixpkgs-unstable` for `nix` users)** by [changing your channel][nix-channel].

First, setting the following:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
   nix.extraOptions = ''
      experimental-features = nix-command flakes
   '';
   nix.package = pkgs.nixUnstable;
}
```

Then, updating the channel:

```bash
$ sudo nix-channel --list
nixos https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-22.11
$ sudo nix-channel --remove nixos
$ sudo nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable nixos
$ sudo nixos-rebuild switch --update
```

> If you don't want, you can drop into a
> `nixUnstable` supporting shell with:
>
> ```bash
> nix-shell -I nixpkgs=channel:nixpkgs-unstable -p nixUnstable --command "nix --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' develop -f . mayastor"
> ```
>
> Don't want to use `nixUnstable`? **That's ok!** Use `nix-shell` and `nix-build` as you normally would.

**Want to run or hack on Mayastor?** _You need more configuration!_ See
[running][doc-run], then [testing][doc-test].

You can use a tool like [`direnv`][direnv] to automate `nix shell` entry.
If you are unable to use the Nix provided Rust for some reason, there are `norust` and
`nospdk` arguments to Nix shell. `nix-shell --arg norust true`

After cloning the repository don't forget to run a:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

to initialize the submodules.

## Iterative Builds

Contributors often build Mayastor repeatedly during the development process.
Using [`nix develop`][nix-develop] to enter a more persistent development shell can help improve
iteration time:

```bash
nix develop -f . io-engine
```

Once entered, you can start any tooling (eg `code .`) to ensure the correct resources are available.
The project can then be interacted with like any other Rust project.

Building:

```bash
cargo build
cargo build --release
```

**Want to run or hack on Mayastor?** _You need more configuration!_ See
[running][doc-running], then [testing][doc-testing].

Whilst the nix develop will allow you to build mayastor exactly as the image build, it might not have all the necessary components required for testing.
For that you might want to use the explicit shell configuration file: ci.nix:

```bash
nix-shell ci.nix
```

To ensure you are aware of this, we greet you with a nice cow.

## Artifacts

There are a few ways to build Mayastor! If you're hacking on Mayastor, it's best to use
[`nix develop`][nix-develop] (above) then turn to traditional Rust tools. If you're looking for releases,
use [`nix build`][nix-build] or [`nix bundle`][nix-bundle] depending on your needs.

> **Why is the build process this way?**
>
> Mayastor creates [_reproducible builds_][reproducible-builds], it won't use any of your
> local system dependencies (other than `nix`). This is a component of the best practices of the
> [Core Infrastructure Initiative][cii-best-practices]. More on how Nix works can be found in the
> [Nix paper][nix-paper].

### Building non-portable Nix derivations

You can build release binaries of Mayastor with [`nix build`][nix-build]:

```bash
for PKG in io-engine; do
  echo "Building ${PKG} to artifacts/pkgs/${PKG}"; \
  nix build -f . -o artifacts/pkgs/${PKG} ${PKG};
done
```

Try them as if they were installed:

```rust
nix shell -f . io-engine
```

### Building portable Nix bundles

In order to make an artifact which can be distributed, we use [`nix bundle`][nix-bundle].

> **TODO:** We currently don't generate bundles some executables, such as
> `io-engine-client`. This is coming.

```bash
for BUNDLE in io-engine; do
  echo "Bundling ${BUNDLE} to artifacts/bundle/${BUNDLE}"; \
  nix bundle -f . -o artifacts/bundles/${BUNDLE} ${BUNDLE};
done
```

Test them:

```bash
for FILE in artifacts/bundles/*; do
 echo "Testing bundle ${FILE}..."
 ${FILE} --version
done
```

### Building Docker images

Build the Docker images with the CI build script:

```bash
  ❯ ./scripts/release.sh --help
  Usage: release.sh [OPTIONS]

  Options:
    -d, --dry-run              Output actions that would be taken, but don't run them.
    -h, --help                 Display this text.
    --registry <host[:port]>   Push the built images to the provided registry.
    --debug                    Build debug version of images where possible.
    --skip-build               Don't perform nix-build.
    --skip-publish             Don't publish built images.
    --image           <image>  Specify what image to build.
    --alias-tag       <tag>    Explicit alias for short commit hash tag.
    --tag             <tag>    Explicit tag (overrides the git tag).

  Examples:
    release.sh --registry 127.0.0.1:5000

  ❯ ./scripts/release.sh --registry localhost:5000 --image "mayastor-io-engine"
```

Build the Docker images with [`nix build`][nix-build]:

```bash
  nix-build --out-link artifacts/docker/mayastor-io-engine-image -A images.mayastor-io-engine
```

**Optionally,** the generated Docker images will **not** tag to the `latest`. You may wish to do that if
you want to run them locally:

```bash
  ./scripts/release.sh --registry docker.io/your-registry --image "mayastor-io-engine --alias-tag latest"
```

### Building KVM images

> **TODO:** We're still writing this! Sorry!

### Building Artifacts the Hard Way

> This isn't really the 'hard way', you'll still use `cargo`.

> **TODO:** We're still writing this! Sorry! For now, please refer to
> `spdk-rs` README on this matter.
